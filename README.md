# Trimming_String

Once upon a time in a kingdom of code, a programmer named Trim was determined to become the best. The king announced a challenge to all coders in the kingdom: write a function that would trim a string if it was longer than a given maximum length. The trimmed string should end with "..." and these dots also counted towards the string length.

Trim worked hard and finally came up with a solution. He wrote a function that took two arguments, the string and the maximum length. If the maximum length was less than or equal to 3, the dots wouldn't add to the string length. If the string was shorter or equal to the maximum length, the function would simply return the string without trimming or dots.

The king was impressed and declared Trim the winner of the challenge. Trim's name became known for writing clean and efficient code and he was admired by all.

And now, your job is to find the solution Trim found. Can you rise to the challenge and become known for writing clean code like Trim?
